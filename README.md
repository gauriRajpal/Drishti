# Object Detection for the Visually Impaired

This Android application is designed to assist visually impaired individuals by providing real-time object detection using deep learning models. The app utilizes TensorFlow, Android Studio, Kotlin, and the SSD-MobileNet architecture trained on the COCO dataset to detect and identify objects from the environment.

## Features
- **Real-time Object Detection**: The app uses the SSD-MobileNet model to detect various objects in real-time through the camera feed.
- **Audio Feedback**: Once an object is detected, the app provides audio feedback to help users identify the object detected.
- **Accessibility Support**: The app is built with accessibility features to ensure it is easy to use for visually impaired users.

## Technologies Used
- **Android Studio**: The primary IDE used to develop the app.
- **Kotlin**: The programming language used for writing the app.
- **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow Lite is used to implement the pre-trained object detection model.
- **SSD-MobileNet**: A fast, lightweight object detection model designed for mobile devices.
- **COCO Dataset**: The app is trained on the COCO dataset, which contains a wide variety of common objects.

## Requirements
- **Android Device**: Requires Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or higher.
- **Permissions**: The app requires the following permissions to function:
  - Camera: For real-time object detection through the camera feed.
  - Microphone (optional): For audio feedback of detected objects.
  
## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Ensure that you have the necessary SDKs and dependencies installed:
   - Android SDK (API level 21 or above)
   - TensorFlow Lite dependencies

4. Build and run the app on an Android device or emulator.

## Usage
1. Launch the app.
2. Grant the necessary permissions (camera and microphone).
3. Point the camera towards the objects in the environment.
4. The app will start processing the camera feed and detect objects in real-time.
5. Upon detecting an object, the app will speak out the name of the object through text-to-speech.

## Example Output
- **"Person detected."**
- **"Cup detected."**
- **"Car detected."**

## Model Details
- **Model**: SSD-MobileNet V1
- **Dataset**: COCO (Common Objects in Context)
- **Framework**: TensorFlow Lite

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to improve the app and its functionalities. To contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch.
3. Implement your changes.
4. Submit a pull request.
